# TODO

## High priority

- server to log URL + date
- badge updating should only happen when a tab is made active.
- confirm endpoint delete
- in options, tabs don't all look right (all but + have a line under them)
- home page should say more
- sort nicknames in context menu

## Low priority

- fix jade vs mustache discrepancy
- temporarily highlight arriving items in /view
- allow specifying a webhook for each endpoint?  but how? per user config?
- get & add title to URLs?
- use embed.ly in /view?
- editing of endpoints
- server command line arg to set port
