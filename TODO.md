# TODO

## High priority

- client-side auto-updating history view
- server settings to respect username/password, when supplied
- server to log URL + date
- badge updating should only happen when a tab is made active.
- confirm endpoint delete
- in options, tabs don't all look right (all but + have a line under them)

## Low priority

- allow specifying a webhook for each endpoint
- add title to URLs?
- in history view, tabs for most frequent, most recent, click on a user for their urls
- server command line args to set port
