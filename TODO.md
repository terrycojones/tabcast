# TODO

## High priority

- server to log URL + date
- badge updating should only happen when a tab is made active.
- confirm endpoint delete
- in options, tabs don't all look right (all but + have a line under them)
- home page should say more
- sort nicknames in context menu

## Low priority

- passwords could be encrypted
- temporarily highlight arriving items in /view
- allow specifying a webhook for each endpoint
- add title to URLs?
- server command line args to set port
- embed.ly?
- editing endpoints
